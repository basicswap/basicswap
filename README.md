# Simple Atomic Swap Network - Proof of Concept

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tecnovert/basicswap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tecnovert/basicswap)

## Overview

Simple atomic swap experiment, doesn't have many interesting features yet.
Not ready for real world use.

Uses Particl secure messaging and Decred style atomic swaps.

The Particl node is used to hold the keys and sign for the swap transactions.
Other nodes can be run in pruned mode.
A node must be run for each coin type traded.
In the future it should be possible to use data from explorers instead of running a node.

## Currently a work in progress

Not ready for real-world use.
