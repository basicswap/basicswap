## About

The BasicSwap DEX is a privacy-first and decentralized exchange which features cross-chain atomic swaps and a distributed order book.

[BasicSwap](https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/glossary.html#term-BasicSwap) is a cross-chain and privacy-centric DEX (decentralized exchange) that lets you trade cryptocurrencies with no third party involvement. Its distributed order book lets you make or take orders at no cost and trade within a free and open environment without central points of failure.

This DEX protocol was built in direct response to the increasingly invasive demands and data mining practices of today’s cryptocurrency exchanges. It strives to bring more decentralized and more private cryptocurrency trading conditions for all.

BasicSwap is still in beta. This means that, while it already offers most of the vital trading features you’d expect to see on centralized exchanges, it is still in heavy development, and many more features will come about in the near future.

Check out our [roadmap](https://basicswapdex.com/roadmap) to get a better idea of what we've got planned for it!

## Features

We plan on adding many other cryptocurrencies moving forward, including ETH and its ERC-20 tokens. However, due to the true cross-chain nature of the BasicSwap DEX protocol, each integration has to be done on a case-by-case basis.

If you’d like to add a cryptocurrency to BasicSwap, either [apply for a listing using our listing application form](https://forms.gle/9DsHoHTJVqSiMNHW9), or try coding the integration yourself by referencing how other cryptocurrencies have been added. Follow [this link](https://academy.particl.io/en/latest/basicswap-guides/basicswapguides_apply.html) for more information on how to integrate a coin yourself.
